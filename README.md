# Simple-Digital-Clock-in-Unity
Welcome!
this is a simple application made in Unity using C#. it's not much but feel free to use it's code &lt;3

DEMO:
(https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-255511)

How it works:
it has a single script called ClockController under scripts folder. contains Update method.
in the Update method, it fills the ClockText component with your system's clock. also toggles 2 little circles to shows the clock is working and not freezed.
don't worry about the performance! the application target framerate is set to 1. so Update method runs one time every second.

wanna talk to me? comment and I'll talk back! thanks <3
